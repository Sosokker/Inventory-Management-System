# Inventory Management System

## Overview
This project is an inventory management system (Let's call it InvtrackPRO, Thank ChatGPT for this nameðŸ˜‚)
 using the `Django web framework` and `PostgreSQL` as the relational database.

This inventory management system focuses on wholesale business where it needs to have warehouses, suppliers, and orders from customers. Anyway, this project will rely much on admin functionality, and the admin needs to manually add transactions.
